[![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20to%20build%20a%20Node.js%20API%20Rest%20that%20scales&url=https://github.com/alexgenovese/scalable-rest-api-node)

One of the most popular Node.js frameworks is Express.js. It offers an easy approach to building applications at different scales. As a project grows, it becomes hard to scale at some point adding new routes, services and it really makes the job very hard.

I tried to answer creating this repo for a product I'm working on and I think can make the life easier to somebody and It's still evolving.
